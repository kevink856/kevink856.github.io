<div style="font-size: 20px"><strong>About</strong></div>

Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a sophomore undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/) studying [Math-CS](https://mathematics.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s). When I'm not spending my time on my personal life or with friends, I self-learn concepts in computer science or create projects to practice them. My passion is game development, so my goal is to eventually develop a game of my own or join a team as a developer. Follow my journey or contact me through the sidebar!
