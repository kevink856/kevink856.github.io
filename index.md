<div style="font-size: 25px"><strong>About</strong></div>

Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a sophomore undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/) studying [Math-CS](https://mathematics.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s). When I'm not spending my time on my personal life or with friends, I self-learn concepts in computer science or create projects to practice them. My passion is game development, so my goal is to eventually develop a game of my own or join a team as a developer. Follow my journey or contact me through the sidebar!

<div style="font-size: 25px"><strong>Experience</strong></div>

Over the years, I have learned many concepts and programming languages in different areas of computer science. My first and most familiar language is Java, with which I:
* Taught and tutored hundreds of elementary - high school students
* Learned Data Structures / Algorithms
* Learned Object-Oriented Programming

and created several projects:
* [Graphical Sort](https://replit.com/@kevink856/Actual-Graphical-Sort?v=1) ([file](./data/index/Main.java)).
	* Learned how to use Java's AWT and Swing API's for graphics
	* Learned how to hard code sorting algo's into graphical components
	* Learned action / event listeners
* [Markdown Parser](https://github.com/kevink856/markdown-parser)
	* Learned Unit and Functional Testing
	* Learned other concepts of SDLC like CI/CD
	* Learned Bash scripting and Makefile

Eventually, my second language was Python, as it was easy to learn and similar to Java in many aspects. Using Python, I created this *earlier* version of a [Graphical Sort](https://replit.com/@kevink856/sortingdisplay?v=1) ([file](./data/index/main.py)) that incorporates animation.

Since then, I've learned several other programming languages that I frequently use and practice with. Here is a list of all languages I've learned and used:

> *Java, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash, MATLAB*

My latest and biggest project is [**Recall**](https://github.com/kevink856/RecallBot), which is a Discord bot that listens to messages on a Discord server, parses them, and stores them in an SQL database. I also made a website that has documentation on its features and more (WIP). Through this project, I learned:
* JavaScript, Node.js, Discord.js, HTML+CSS
* How to use the Discord.js and SQLite3 API
* Integration Testing and SQL safety

I thoroughly enjoyed working on every single project, even smaller ones not listed here or projects for school. Learning new things in the vast field of computer science is always exciting and I can't wait to work on a new project!

<div style="font-size: 25px"><strong>Education</strong></div>

I attend the University of California - San Diego, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. My major is "Mathematics - Computer Science", which is a mathematics degree with a specialization on theoretical computer science. I am a sophomore with junior standing with a GPA or 3.63/4.00, and I expect to graduate on **June, 2025**.

You can find my resume [here](./data/index/Kim_Kyoomin_Resume.pdf), my academic history [here](./data/index/academichistoryreviewpdf.pdf), and my major requirements [here](https://math.ucsd.edu/sites/math.ucsd.edu/files/img/undergrad-handbook/21-22-MA30.png).
