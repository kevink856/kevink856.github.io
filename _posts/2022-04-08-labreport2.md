# Blog #1 - Using CSE 15L's ieng6

> *Tutorial for incoming students on using the CSE 15L specific account on ieng6, including installing VSCode, remote connection, useful Bash commands, SSH keys, and optimizing remote connection*


Utilizing a remote server for programming offers vast advantages for any programmer, no matter the project. Such "remote development" offers a workstation to program on from any system remotely, meaning what system you use will not affect performance! Such a dedicated server could also perform with much more efficiency than a local environment, especially with larger tasks. On top of that, all of these advantages are even more significant when considering collaboration with other programmers, where everyone could have a shared workstation to conveniently work on!

This tutorial will introduce utilizing such a server, specifically with a remote server, **ieng6**, provided by [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), and the [CSE 15L](http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/) course. I will show step-by-step details to utilize this resource, from the installation of VSCode, which contains the terminal I will be using. After reading this blog, you will be ready to explore remote development with a strong, fundamental grasp on it!
