<div style="font-size: 25px; color: #267CB9"><strong>About</strong></div>

Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a junior undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/) studying [Computer Science](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/curric/CSE-ug.html). When I'm not spending my time on my personal life, with friends, or on school, I self-learn concepts in computer science or create projects to practice them. My biggest passion is game development, so my goal is to eventually develop a game of my own or join a team as a developer. Follow my journey or contact me through the sidebar!

<div style="font-size: 25px; color: #267CB9"><strong>Experience</strong></div>

Over the years, I have learned many concepts and programming languages in different areas of computer science. My first and most familiar language is Java, with which I:
* Taught and tutored hundreds of elementary - high school students
* Learned Data Structures / Algorithms
* Learned Object-Oriented Programming

and created several projects:
* [Graphical Sort](https://github.com/kevink856/GraphicalSort)
	* Learned how to use Java's AWT and Swing API's for graphics
	* Learned how to hard code sorting algorithms into graphical components
	* Learned action / event listeners
* [Markdown Parser](https://github.com/kevink856/markdown-parser)
	* Learned Unit and Functional Testing
	* Learned other concepts of SDLC like CI/CD
	* Learned Bash scripting and Makefile
 * 
Since then, I've learned several other programming languages that I frequently use and practice with.

I thoroughly enjoyed working on every single project, even smaller ones not listed here or projects for school. Learning new things in the vast field of computer science is always exciting and you can find me always working on a new thing.

<div style="font-size: 25px; color: #267CB9"><strong>Education</strong></div>

I attend the University of California - San Diego, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I am a junior with senior standing with a GPA or 3.70/4.00, and I expect to graduate on **June, 2025**.

You can find my resume [here](../data/Kevin_Kim_Resume.pdf), and my academic history [here](./data/index/academichistoryreviewpdf.pdf).
