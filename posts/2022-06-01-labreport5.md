# Blog #5 - Comparing Implementations

> *Discussing the process of debugging two different implementations of a project, particularly in the an example project* Markdown-Tester

Writing a well-designed program will almost always result in some collaborative effort, and such a process of collaborative development can mean several branches of the same program be active at once. In other words, multiple implementations of a program may be ready to test before any of them are pushed to the main branch, and it is especially important to be apt at debugging two comparative implementations.

This blog will explore the development of a specific project, *Markdown-Tester*, which scrapes links in **Markdown** files (extension `.md`). It will show the debugging process with two different implementations of *Markdown-Tester*.

## **Comparing Tests**

The first step to debugging in any program is to locate a bug and isolate it, with unit tests being one way to accomplish this. In a simple program like *Markdown-Tester* that simply reads text from files, unit tests are all that is needed.

Running unit tests with [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>JUnit</b></span>](https://junit.org/junit5/) may be efficient and intuitive for one program, but when comparing results of multiple different programs for the same tests, results can get unclear. Additionally, for *Markdown-Tester*, there are over 600 tests utilized, so seeing every test at once may not be useful.

To solve this, there are several ways implementation can be made, including simply utilizing **JUnit** to organize the tests in a readable way. However, another way to do this with more direct accessibility is taking advantage of **Bash scripts**.

> **Scripts** automate processes for programmers where a manual task may be too demanding

An especially convenient way to use scripts in this case is to print out each resulting output and its corresponding test number in a `.txt` file. An advantage of this is that the script could output each different implementation of the program into a separate `.txt` file, allowing for separate yet organized displays of output.

Writing a script for such a task may look like this:
![Script](/images/blog_images/blog_05/script.png)

> This script will output the first set of results in **output.txt**, and the second in **output2.txt** using two **`for`** loops, and is executed using **`bash script.sh`**, where **script.sh** is the name of the Script file

To take this one step further, the command **`vimdiff`** can be used to show differences in two text files side-by-side, allowing for a very easy and intuitive way to compare results between two implementations of the same program. 

Using **`vimdiff`** with two output files may look like this:
![Vimdiff](/images/blog_images/blog_05/vimdiff.png)
> Note: **`vimdiff`** will automatically highlight the differences in the two files, like for test **194**

Using this method, there are many visible differences in test results, and test **194** and **342** will be focused on.

## **Test Case 194**

This test can be found [here](/data/blog_05/194.md).

To determine the correctness of a test, [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Commonmark</b></span>](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) was used for **Markdown** link formatting.

* According to **Commonmark**, the correct output for test 194 is `my_(url)`

From the previously shown display using **`vimdiff`**, the following difference could be found for test **194**:

![194](/images/blog_images/blog_05/194locate.png)
> Note: Both implementations are incorrect

From this difference, we can see that the **Markdown** formatting of links regarding colons (`:`) is not implemented for either implementation of *Markdown-Tester*. However, the first implementation shows a faulty detection of a link, since a url wrapped in parenthesis is only considered a link if it is adjacent to the brackets:

`[Text](Link)`

Regardless, the second implementation may be more useful to focus on, as the issue of an unimplemented colon case is isolated in this test (*ie. no other visible issues*). 

As mentioned, the bug is that the case of colons in **Markdown** formatting was not considered, and therefore is not recognized as a separator between the text and link. For a fix, this implementation should check for the index of `:` after the brackets, and detect if it comes immediately after the brackets, just like the parentheses check.

> Note: The highlighted area would be where the colon is kept track of along with the parentheses, where both would check adjacency later


&nbsp;
## **Test Case 342**

This test can be found [here](/data/blog_05/342.md).

To determine the correctness of a test, [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Commonmark</b></span>](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) was used for **Markdown** link formatting.

* According to **Commonmark**, the correct output for test 342 is no link

From the previously shown display using **`vimdiff`**, the following difference could be found for test **342**:

![342](/images/blog_images/blog_05/342locate.png)
> Note: Only the first implementation is incorrect

This difference shows that only the first implementation has faulty behavior regarding this test case, while the second implementation shows an output that is expected. 

The bug is that in the first implementation, backticks (`) are not considered when they ignore all **Markdown** formatting wrapped between them. For a fix, this implementation should check for backticks immediately behind either bracket, look for a second backtick, and skip over anything they wrap around.

![342 Implementation](/images/blog_images/blog_05/342implementation.png)
> Note: The highlighted area would be where `[` and `]` are checked for backticks immediately behind them, and a loop to skip over similarly backticked brackets


&nbsp;

This is by no means the only method to debug multiple implementations of a program at once, but it is a convenient and very effective way to visualize in cases where manual work is not feasible, like with hundreds or thousands of tests. Hopefully, going through these test cases where the debugging process with Bash scripts and **`vimdiff`** were applied has helped in understanding how to effectively compare implementations!
