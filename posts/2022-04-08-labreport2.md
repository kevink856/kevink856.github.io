# Blog #1 - Using CSE 15L's ieng6

> *Tutorial for incoming students on using the CSE 15L specific account on ieng6, including installing VSCode, remote connection, useful Bash commands, SSH keys, and optimizing remote connection*

Utilizing a remote server for programming offers vast advantages for any programmer, no matter the project. Such "remote development" offers a workstation to program on from any system remotely, meaning what system you use will not affect performance! Such a dedicated server could also perform with much more efficiency than a local environment, especially with larger tasks. On top of that, all of these advantages are even more significant when considering collaboration with other programmers, where everyone could have a shared workstation to conveniently work on!

This tutorial will introduce utilizing such a server, specifically with a remote server, **ieng6**, provided by [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), and the [CSE 15L](http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/) course. I will show step-by-step details to utilize this resource, from the installation of VSCode, which contains the terminal I will be using. After reading this blog, you will be ready to explore remote development with a strong, fundamental grasp on it!

&nbsp;
## **Installing VSCode**

**Visual Studio Code** is a powerful yet simple code editor that can serve as a simple compiler for just about every streamlined language. To effectively and efficiently use a remote server, an editor like VSCode is perfect for the job, with its ability to support almost any language you might use for it, and the convenient **integrated terminal**.

To install Visual Studio Code, you can start by downloading their [**installer**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on their website.

https://code.visualstudio.com/

After downloading the appropriate installer for your system's OS and processing power, the installation wizard will guide you in installing the editor.

Upon opening Visual Studio Code, the application should greet you with a window like this:

![VSC Homepage](/images/blog_images/blog_01/vscHomepage.png)

Click the **"Terminal"** button on the top *(highlighted in red in the image)*, and click **"New Terminal"** to get started! You are now ready to use a remote server!

> You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+\` to open a new terminal (or Command+Option+Ctrl+Shift+\` for Mac)

&nbsp;
## **Remotely Connecting**

UC San Diego's Computer Lab provides server systems that can be connected to from anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection. The machines are named **"ieng6"**, and the actual domain name for connecting to these systems is `ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

In order to connect to any of these machines, we utilize the terminal that is built-in to VSCode, of which the instructions to opening one was stated above. In particular, the process of connecting begins with the Bash command `ssh`. This stands for **"Secure Shell"**, and it allows two computers to securely communicate and interact with each other. The syntax for this command is as follows:

`ssh user@host [Command(s)]`

With respect to the above syntax, "user" correlates to the username of the user trying to connect, "host" refers to the address of the server, and any number of other commands can be optionally run in conjunction.

For UCSD's **"ieng6"** machines, the host address will always be `ieng6.ucsd.edu`, which is the same as the domain name. However, finding a user's specific username may be more complicated, depending on their experience with UC San Diego's computer systems.

To find your username, you can use UCSD's [**Account Lookup**](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) resource. Upon logging in, you will be greeted with a webpage similar to this:

![Account Lookup](/images/blog_images/blog_01/accLookup.png)
*For this tutorial, it is assumed the user is enrolled in the course CSE 15L*

> If you have trouble logging in to your account, you may need to reset your password. A detailed tutorial for this is provided [here](/data/blog_01/How-to-Reset-your-Password.pdf) (credited to Yasushi Oh)

The text on the button (*highlighted in red in the image*) is your username which you can use to securely connect to `ieng6`!

Now that you have all the information you need to use the `ssh` command, you can follow the syntax provided to use the command in such a way in the VSCode terminal:

`ssh cs15lsp22[...]@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Running this command in the terminal will prompt the user with a password to enter, which is required to securely connect to the server. The password will be what you set it as when resetting your password.

![Password](/images/blog_images/blog_01/pwd.png)

> The **Shell** is designed to hide your password as you type it, so nothing is wrong if your password or even astericks don't show up while typing!

If everything functions and the password is accepted, you will be connected to a machine in the `ieng6` system! 


&nbsp;
## **Trying Some Commands**

As VSCode's integrated terminal operates based on **Windows PowerShell** by default, all commands by default are run with Bash. As such, it is useful to be familiar with the vast commands Bash offers, and I will explore particular ones that are useful in interacting with the server in a basic way.

> To learn more about Bash, you can refer to documentation [here](https://devdocs.io/bash/).

&nbsp;

Many of these basic commands are especially useful when interacting with the `ieng6` system, but they can be equally useful for the local system. In the following commands, arguments enclosed in brackets **[ ]** will indicate optional arguments which the command can run without. Additionally, for commands with `[option(s)]`, you can find supported arguments in the documentation referred above.

*Note: the commands shown are by no means the only commands you need nor the most powerful. They are simply particularly useful in the context of basic interaction, especially in a **remote environment** like this*

* **`ls [option(s)] [file(s)]` - List files**

    *Lists all files within the given directory. Useful to view all files in the remote server, since there is no convenient way of viewing them otherwise, unlike a local system*

* **`touch [option(s)] file(s)` - Make files**

    *Creates new file(s) within the given directory. Can be more convenient than creating file(s) locally then moving them, especially when creating many files at once*

* **`mkdir [option(s)] directory(s)` - Make directories**

    *Creates new directory(s). Like `touch`, can be especially convenient and optimal when creating multiple directories at once*

* **`pwd [option(s)]` - Print working directory**

    *Prints the current directory that is being worked in. Can be useful in a situation like this, where it can be easy to lose track of the working directory when going back and forth between terminals*

* **`cd [option(s)] directory` - Change directory**

    *Changes the current working directory. Useful to traverse a system, especially the server, since there is no convenient way of viewing them otherwise, unlike a local system*

* **`mv [option(s)] argument(s)` - Move / Renamed directories**

    *Moves or renames directories or files. Powerful command to move or rename many things at once*

* **`rm [option(s)] argument(s)` - Remove directory(s)**

    *Deletes files or entire directories (and their contents). Useful and powerful command that can be combined with options to delete large amounts of files and directories*

* **`cat [option(s)] [file(s)]` - Read files**

    *Mainly used to display file(s). Can be useful to view the contents of a file*

* **`exit` - Exit directory**

    *Exits out of the working environment. Useful to use one command to end a script, to logout of a SSH session, or to even close the terminal entirely*

&nbsp;

Here is an example of some of these commands being used:

*This example is within the server's environment, but can be done locally as well*

## **Optimizing Remote Running**

As mentioned before, some commands allow them to be executed in conjunction with other commands, allowing for efficiency and optimization . Beyond this, we can further optimize the process of interacting with files between the local system and the server.
