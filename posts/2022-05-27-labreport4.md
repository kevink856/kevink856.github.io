# Blog #4 - Implementing Debugging

> *Discussing the process of implementing debugging, particularly in the development of an example project* Markdown-Tester

Debugging is surely useful and a key factor in improving any code base to accomplish what a programmer desires, but it is equally important to understand how to utilize it. An efficient process of debugging can hasten the development of any program and make the lives of the developers much easier.

This blog will explore the development of a specific project, *Markdown-Tester*, which scrapes links in **Markdown** files (extension `.md`) It will show how the process of debugging was efficiently used to implement new changes in code to fix buggy behavior.

## **Markdown-Parser**

This blog will explore the idea of applying debugging efficiently on a particular project called *Markdown-Tester*, which scrapes links in a given **Markdown** file. There will be two different versions of the program developed throughout the blog with 3 identical test cases to portray how the debugging process is similar among different programs. 

The link to the first version of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/kevink856/markdown-parser).

The link to the second version of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/HantianLin/markdown-parser).

Each project contains a file called **`MarkdownParse.java`** and **`MarkdownParseTest.java`**, which are the implementation of the program and the tester for the test files, respectively.

The test files, named **`test-snippet1.md`**, **`test-snippet2.md`**, and **`test-snippet3.md`** are example **Markdown** files with different formats of links to test how well the program detects or does not detect links.

Each test file will be explored separately, yet both projects' implementations will be explored in conjunction. All three cases will fail in the beginning, and the process of debugging will be applied to solve each case for both programs.

Additionally, to determine what each output should be, [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Commonmark</b></span>](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) was used for **Markdown** link formatting.

## **Test Case 1**

This test case can be found in more detail [here](/data/blog_04/test_snippet1.md).
> This test exemplifies the use of backticks ( **`** ) to complicate the format with backticks involved.

In this case, the output should be the following list: 
```
["`google.com", "google.com", "ucsd.edu"]
```

The test was implemented in **`MarkdownParseTest.java`** in the following way:
![Snippet 1 Test](/images/blog_images/blog_04/testsnippet1.png)

This test case fails and reveals buggy behavior for both programs. Upon compiling and running **`MarkdownParseTest.java`**, the output shows the test failing and the stack trace of it:
![Test Fail 1](/images/blog_images/blog_04/fail1.png)

**`MarkdownParseTest.java`** can be altered to account for this problem by finding a range of backticks (starting from **`currentIndex`**), and to ignore any open / closed brackets found inside that range. The program would simply continue searching for brackets if they are wrapped in backticks.

Such a fix would be very optimal to implement (<10 lines of code).


&nbsp;
## **Test Case 2**

This test case can be found in more detail [here](/data/blog_04/test_snippet2.md).
> This test exemplifies the use of nested brackets / parenthesis to complicate the format with nested brackets / parenthesis involved, and exemplifies the use of backslash.

In this case, the output should be the following list: 
```
["a.com", "a.com(())", "example.com"]
```

The test was implemented in **`MarkdownParseTest.java`** in the following way:
![Snippet 2 Test](/images/blog_images/blog_04/testsnippet2.png)

This test case fails and reveals buggy behavior for both programs. Upon compiling and running **`MarkdownParseTest.java`**, the output shows the test failing and the stack trace of it:
![Test Fail 2](/images/blog_images/blog_04/fail2.png)

**`MarkdownParseTest.java`** can be altered to account for this problem, and for the first problem *(nested brackets)*, it can be changed to continue searching for an open bracket as long as the next open bracket is behind the closed bracket. The second problem *(nested parenthesis)* can be solved by counting the amount of open parenthesis and searching for that many closed parenthesis, breaking if failed. Finally, the backslash format can be followed by checking if each bracket / parenthesis follows a backslash, and if so, to ignore it.

Such a fix would not be very optimal as it would take a large amount of code lines to implement.


&nbsp;
## **Test Case 3**

This test case can be found in more detail [here](/data/blog_04/test_snippet3.md).
> This test exemplifies the use of newlines within links to complicate the format with newlines involved.

In this case, the output should be the following list: 
```
["https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule"]
```

The test was implemented in **`MarkdownParseTest.java`** in the following way:
![Snippet 3 Test](/images/blog_images/blog_04/testsnippet3.png)

This test case fails and reveals buggy behavior for both programs. Upon compiling and running **`MarkdownParseTest.java`**, the output shows the test failing and the stack trace of it:
![Test Fail 3](/images/blog_images/blog_04/fail3.png)

**`MarkdownParseTest.java`** can be altered to account for this problem by instead of adding text between the parenthesis of a *"valid"* link format, it would be stored in a variable first. This variable can be then checked if it contains any whitespaces, and if so, to not add it, since no spaces nor newlines are allowed in **Markdown**'s formatting.

Such a fix could be very optimal to implement (<10 lines of code).

>Note: Java **Scanner** recognizes newlines and spaces both as whitespace

There are many methods and improvements to developing programs, but this way of locating and solving bugs as simply as possible serves to speed up the process of development. Hopefully, going through these examples of locating an issue with a test case and applying the debugging process to fix it has given an idea of how to efficiently debug!
