Utilizing a remote server for programming offers vast advantages for any programmer, no matter the project. Such "remote development" offers a workstation to program on from any system remotely, meaning what system you use will not affect performance! Such a dedicated server could also perform with much more efficiency than a local environment, especially with larger tasks. On top of that, all of these advantages are even more significant when considering collaboration with other programmers, where everyone could have a shared workstation to conveniently work on!

This tutorial will introduce utilizing such a server, specifically with a remote server, **ieng6**, provided by [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>UC San Diego</b></span>](https://ucsd.edu/), and the [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>CSE 15L</b></span>](http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/) course. I will show step-by-step details to utilize this resource, from the installation of VSCode, which contains the terminal I will be using. After reading this blog, you will be ready to explore remote development with a strong, fundamental grasp on it!

## **Installing VSCode**

**Visual Studio Code** is a powerful yet simple code editor that can serve as a simple compiler for just about every streamlined language. To effectively and efficiently use a remote server, an editor like VSCode is perfect for the job, with its ability to support almost any language you might use for it, and the convenient **integrated terminal**.

To install Visual Studio Code, you can start by downloading their [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>installer</b></span>](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on their website.

![Visual Studio Code](/images/blog_images/blog_01/vsc.png)
https://code.visualstudio.com/

After downloading the appropriate installer for your system's OS and processing power, the installation wizard will guide you in installing the editor.

Upon opening Visual Studio Code, the application should greet you with a window like this:

![VSC Homepage](/images/blog_images/blog_01/vscHomepage.png)

Click the **"Terminal"** button on the top *(highlighted in red in the image)*, and click **"New Terminal"** to get started! You are now ready to use a remote server!

> You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+\` to open a new terminal (or Command+Option+Ctrl+Shift+\` for Mac)

&nbsp;
## **Remotely Connecting**

UC San Diego's Computer Lab provides server systems that can be connected to from anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection. The machines are named **"ieng6"**, and the actual domain name for connecting to these systems is `ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

In order to connect to any of these machines, we utilize the terminal that is built-in to VSCode, of which the instructions to opening one was stated above. In particular, the process of connecting begins with the Bash command `ssh`. This stands for **"Secure Shell"**, and it allows two computers to securely communicate and interact with each other. The syntax for this command is as follows:

**`ssh user@host [Command(s)]`**

With respect to the above syntax, "user" correlates to the username of the user trying to connect, "host" refers to the address of the server, and any number of other commands can be optionally run in conjunction.

For UCSD's **"ieng6"** machines, the host address will always be `ieng6.ucsd.edu`, which is the same as the domain name. However, finding a user's specific username may be more complicated, depending on their experience with UC San Diego's computer systems.

&nbsp;

To find your username, you can use UCSD's [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Account Lookup</b></span>](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) resource. Upon logging in, you will be greeted with a webpage similar to this:

![Account Lookup](/images/blog_images/blog_01/accLookup.png)
*For this tutorial, it is assumed the user is enrolled in the course CSE 15L*

> If you have trouble logging in to your account, you may need to reset your password. A detailed tutorial for this is provided [here](/data/blog_01/How-to-Reset-your-Password.pdf) (credited to Yasushi Oh)

The text on the button (*highlighted in red in the image*) is your username which you can use to securely connect to `ieng6`!

Now that you have all the information you need to use the `ssh` command, you can follow the syntax provided to use the command in such a way in the VSCode terminal:

**`ssh cs15lsp22[...]@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

Running this command in the terminal will prompt the user with a password to enter, which is required to securely connect to the server. The password will be what you set it as when resetting your password.

![Password](/images/blog_images/blog_01/pwd.png)

> The **Shell** is designed to hide your password as you type it, so nothing is wrong if your password or even astericks don't show up while typing!

If everything functions and the password is accepted, you will be connected to a machine in the `ieng6` system! 


&nbsp;
## **Trying Some Commands**

As VSCode's integrated terminal operates based on **Windows PowerShell** by default, all commands by default are run with Bash. As such, it is useful to be familiar with the vast commands Bash offers, and I will explore particular ones that are useful in interacting with the server in a basic way.

> To learn more about Bash, you can refer to documentation [here](https://devdocs.io/bash/).

&nbsp;

---

Many of these basic commands are especially useful when interacting with the `ieng6` system, but they can be equally useful for the local system. In the following commands, arguments enclosed in brackets **[ ]** will indicate optional arguments which the command can run without. Additionally, for commands with `[option(s)]`, you can find supported arguments in the documentation referred above.

*Note: the commands shown are by no means the only commands you need nor the most powerful. They are simply particularly useful in the context of basic interaction, especially in a **remote environment** like this*

* **`ls [option(s)] [file(s)]` - List files**

    *Lists all files within the given directory. Useful to view all files in the remote server, since there is no convenient way of viewing them otherwise, unlike a local system*

* **`touch [option(s)] file(s)` - Make files**

    *Creates new file(s) within the given directory. Can be more convenient than creating file(s) locally then moving them, especially when creating many files at once*

* **`mkdir [option(s)] directory(s)` - Make directories**

    *Creates new directory(s). Like `touch`, can be especially convenient and optimal when creating multiple directories at once*

* **`pwd [option(s)]` - Print working directory**

    *Prints the current directory that is being worked in. Can be useful in a situation like this, where it can be easy to lose track of the working directory when going back and forth between terminals*

* **`cd [option(s)] directory` - Change directory**

    *Changes the current working directory. Useful to traverse a system, especially the server, since there is no convenient way of viewing them otherwise, unlike a local system*

* **`mv [option(s)] argument(s)` - Move / Renamed directories**

    *Moves or renames directories or files. Powerful command to move or rename many things at once*

* **`rm [option(s)] argument(s)` - Remove directory(s)**

    *Deletes files or entire directories (and their contents). Useful and powerful command that can be combined with options to delete large amounts of files and directories*

* **`cat [option(s)] [file(s)]` - Read files**

    *Mainly used to display file(s). Can be useful to view the contents of a file*

* **`exit` - Exit directory**

    *Exits out of the working environment. Useful to use one command to end a script, to logout of a SSH session, or to even close the terminal entirely*

&nbsp;

Here is an example of some of these commands being used:

![Terminal Example](/images/blog_images/blog_01/terminalUsage.png)
*This example is within the server's environment, but can be done locally as well*

&nbsp;
## **Using SCP**

So far, this tutorial has shown how to use Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal to interact with both the local and remote systems ***independently***. However, an **SSH** connection between two systems allows for far more powerful tasks.

**`scp`**, which stands for **"Secure Copy Protocol"**, is a command that can be used in the terminal to **securely** transfer files between two hosts. It is a similar command to **`cp`**, which copies files or directories to another location, but **`scp`** expands the reach of the command to different systems entirely. The command's syntax is as follows:

* **`scp [option(s)] source_argument(s) destination_argument(s)`**

*In this example, I will only be copying files from the local system to the server, not vice versa.*

Using this command to copy files from the local system to a remote system will follow the syntax as such:

![scp](/images/blog_images/blog_01/scp.png)

To perform this task, the syntax follows so that the file to be copied is the first argument, and the **directory path** of the location for the copied file to go is the second argument. Notice that the second argument is the username and the address of the destination host, but is followed by **`:~/`**. In Bash, **`~`** (or tilde) is interpreted as a user's **home directory**, or in this case, the server's home directory. As such, the command copies the file to the server's home (**`~`**) directory (**`/`**).

As is shown in the image above, using this command will prompt the user for a password, which is the same password that is used to securely login using **`ssh`**. This will be required everytime **`scp`** is run, as it assures the files are being sent securely.


&nbsp;
## **Using SSH keys**

When using **`scp`**, using a password each time the command is run can get tedious, especially as the command needs to be run more and more times. To simplify this task, we can use **SSH keys**.

**SSH keys** are credentials that can be used during an **`ssh`** protocol as an alternative to entering a password (for both **`ssh`** *and* **`scp`**!). It works by generating a **public** and **private** key file, and the public key file will be copied over to the remote server. These two files create a **key pair** that is used as the secure access credential over a password.

> For an in-depth look at SSH keys and Secure Shell in general, you can visit their website [here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen)

SSH keys are very flexible in types, length, and additional security in keys, and thus the commands can vary extremely depending on what is trying to be achieved. For this example, I will be using a very basic yet strong keygen command that follows this syntax:

**`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`**

*`-t` indicates a specific key type, which in this case is a strong algorithm called **Ed25519**.*

Running the command will show something similar to this:

![SSH keygen](/images/blog_images/blog_01/sshkeygen.png)

Bash automatically finds a directory to save the key pair, but if for some reason it isn't found, you can specify the directory to be the same as the image above (/Users/[user]/.ssh/id_ed25519). You can press `enter` for these prompts without any arguments to use the default argument. In this case, the default argument is the path that is shown above.

Upon pressing `enter`, the terminal should show something similar to this:

![SSH passphrase](/images/blog_images/blog_01/sshpassphrase.png)

> A passphrase (though not required) serves as a two-factor authentication that further secures the key, especially when on a public system. It could be deemed unnecessary if the system it is generated on is secure from other users.

Note that I also did not use any arguments when I was prompted to enter a passphrase, as it is optional. After this, the private and public key is generated and saved in the directory.

The next step is to copy the public key over to the correct directory in the server. If this step has not been done before on the server, it is necessary to first make the directory that the key will go in. After securely connecting to the remote host with **`ssh`**, the following command should be executed:

**`mkdir .ssh`**

This creates a folder named **".ssh"**, which is where the public key will be stored.

Copying over the file should be done from the local system as that is where it is stored. From the local system (having logged out of the server), we can make use of the **`scp`** command to securely transfer the public key to the server with the following syntax:

![SCP keys](/images/blog_images/blog_01/scpkeys.png)

*In the first argument, the file **must** be specified as the .pub variant, as this is the distinction from the public and private key.*

If the steps were followed and there were no issues with this process, using secure commands like **`scp`** and **`ssh`** should use the SSH key pair, removing the need to use a password!


&nbsp;
## **Optimizing Remote Running**

As mentioned before, some commands allow them to be executed in conjunction with other commands, allowing for efficiency and optimization. This is not to be confused with some commands allowing multiple *arguments*, which may involve multiple files or directories. This can be done with the semi-colon `;` to separate commands to be run in order in one command line.

![Semicolon Usage](/images/blog_images/blog_01/semicolon.png)
*Note that `..` refers to the parent directory*

Another optimization that can be used is when running a command on the server only a few times. This can be done with a single command that will execute after logging in with **`ssh`**, then logging out immediately upon execution. To do this, the command must be wrapped in double-quotes `""` like so:

![Semicolon SSH](/images/blog_images/blog_01/sshSemicolon.png)
*Note that `;` can be used in conjunction with the double-quotes*

Beyond this, there are many other ways of optimizing commands in Bash to make the programmer's life much easier, and the most common way to optimize is with **scripts**. Even other notation and syntax can be used to achieve efficiency beyond what has already been stated. 

As this tutorial is meant to cover the basics in comfortably interacting between a remote server and a local system, these functions and many more are beyond the scope of this guide. Please refer to documentation listed throughout this guide for more in-depth information about all of these topics.

I hope you learned something in this blog, and have fun trying it out yourself!
