The skill of debugging is perhaps the most critical and fundamental skill in not only programming, but developing any sort of technology. It is also one of the most flexible and forigiving processes in programming, and is thus important to do well.

## **Debugging**

Before being able to efficiently debug a program, it is necessary to have some good habits first. As mentioned, debugging can be a very flexible process for any program, but to be effective, some key ideas should be kept in mind:

***Test Often!*** - Though it is sometimes easier to write out short programs, even the simplest programs should have testing done. Especially when working collaboratively, being lenient on testing can result in a headache of issues that stagger any further development. Testing often can solve this issue, as writing more tests can help in coming up with uncovered cases. There can also be cases that just happened to be accounted for because of testing often, so it is a good habit to always have tests implemented in any program.

***Commit Often!*** - Sometimes, we need to see a certain history of a program's development. Whether that is to revert changes, access a lost file, or any other reason, committing often prevents these issues that restricts the developer. Committing often, especially with concise, detailed notes can prove to be very useful during the process of debugging. For example, if an issue occurs from a new change that didn't exist before (and this cannot be reverted locally for whatever reason), a commit before the issue is really the quickest and most effective way of dealing with this. Even in smaller projects, having a history saves a lot of time and effort if these problems occur.

***Write Documentation!*** - It is easy to overlook this process, especially when working on a private project alone. However, no matter who the developers are or how many there are, useful documentation allows for greater understanding of the code. Even for a solo project, this skill allows for faster and more efficient debugging. Even beyond simply describing a part of the code, documentation can list the intentions and restrictions behind a part of a program, and even any libraries it used. This step can often times remove the trouble of having to reverse-engineer a test because of an unclear part of a program.

&nbsp;
## **JUnit Testing**

There are many ways to implement testing in any program, but **JUnit** is useful for **unit testing**, which means it helps in testing small parts of the code individually. Using software like **JUnit** instead of manually debugging is ultimately better in every way. Even with smaller programs, having no scalability in testing and having to manually search for mistakes in every feature is simply not feasible.

**JUnit** is a framework for this type of testing specifically for **Java**. It is not supplied by Java, so it must be installed and imported in any program that intends to use it. Here is an example of how it looks on the [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Eclipse IDE</b></span>](https://www.eclipse.org/).

![JUnit Example](/images/blog_images/blog_02/junit.png)
> Full documentation on JUnit and instructions on installation can be found [here](https://junit.org/junit4/faq.html#started_1)

Each of these tests are methods containing one or more tests, all focusing on a single aspect of the program. Within each, they test an individual feature or test case at a time. This approach to testing is much more feasible and scalable to a program that may get larger over time, as the need to search through thousands of lines of code for errors can be replaced by a comprehensive, organized interface of tests.

Implementing one of these test methods can look something like this:

![JUnit Test Example](/images/blog_images/blog_02/junit_test.png)
> Note that each individual test is implemented with the method `assertEquals`, which compares equivalence, and is one of many that **JUnit** provides

If any of these individual tests fail, then the entire test method fails, and **JUnit**'s bundled **Hamcrest** framework interface will show a stack trace of the precise location of the issue, allowing for easy and quick debugging. The examples in the next section will use **JUnit** for testing, and is a very effective method of debugging any program.  

&nbsp;
## **Debugging Examples**

Before exploring some examples of debugging efficiently, it is important to keep some important terms in mind. They will help in further understanding the process of debugging and the examples themselves.

- **`Commit`** - The process of **"applying"** a change to a version of the project
- **`Bug`** - A mistake in a program that results in an **unexpected / undesirable outcome**
- **`Symptom`** - An **indication** that a bug has occurred (ie. the unexpected outcome)
- **`Failure-Inducing Input`** - An **input** of a test that results in **failing** the test, by being an unexpected outcome

With these terms in mind, the following examples will show application of good habits and JUnit with debugging.

Each of the following examples will be parts of the debugging process in a program which reads links in a **Markdown** (.md) file. 

As mentioned before, ***committing often*** is a good habit to have and allows for much easier debugging. Committing an important change before implementing any others can look like this: 

![Fix 1](/images/blog_images/blog_02/fix1.png)
> Note the summary of the commit describes the purpose of the commit (to fix an infinite loop)

In this example, the issue was found from testing [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>this</b></span>](../data/blog_02/testFile1.md) file:

![Test 1](/images/blog_images/blog_02/test1.png)
> Note that even changes to the test files are recorded in a commit, even if they are not each individual commits

This test file was tested using **JUnit** through the terminal on **VSCode**, which proved to be a failure-inducing input, which looks like this:

![Symptom 1](/images/blog_images/blog_02/symptom1.png)

This test output in the terminal shows a **symptom** of the test failing, or more specifically, of an "Out Of Memory" error causing an infinite loop, caused by the failure-inducing input (the test file). The output shows a stack trace that deduces the location of the bug to a specific line of code, which in this case is `MarkdownParseTest.testSingle(MarkdownParseTest.java:11)` (or the 11th line in the file "MarkdownParseTest").

So, the implementation of **JUnit** testing for the program allowed for this **symptom** to be caught within this **failure-inducing input**. This allowed for the **bug** that caused this to be traced back to the code and fixed, and that fix was implemented and committed.

This process of debugging is extremely effective in ensuring that a program is ***correct*** by whatever metric is used to determine such correctness. It ensures that the program is functional, allowing for further development of the project to not only be uncomplicated, but possible in the first place.

Here are some additional examples of this process from the same project:

![Fix 2](/images/blog_images/blog_02/fix2.png)
> Commit of the complete fix, with summary of what caused the change

![Test 2](/images/blog_images/blog_02/test2.png)
> Commit of the changes to the test file which caused this example's symptom

This example uses [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>this</b></span>](../data/blog_02/testFile2.md) file:

![Symptom 2](/images/blog_images/blog_02/symptom2.png)
> Symptom of the failure-inducing input, and the stack trace of the bug

This test output in the terminal shows a **symptom** of the test failing, or more specifically, of an "Index Out Of Bounds" error, caused by the failure-inducing input (the test file with non-link text after a link). The output shows a stack trace that deduces the location of the bug to a specific line of code, which in this case is `MarkdownParseTest.testSingle(MarkdownParseTest.java:11)` (or the 11th line in the file "MarkdownParseTest").

Here is one last example of debugging in this project:

![Fix 3](/images/blog_images/blog_02/fix3.png)
> Commit of the complete fix, with summary of what caused the change

![Test 3](/images/blog_images/blog_02/test3.png)
> Commit of the changes to the test file which caused this example's symptom

This example uses [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>this</b></span>](../data/blog_02/testFile3.md) file:

![Symptom 3](/images/blog_images/blog_02/symptom3.png)
> Symptom of the failure-inducing input

This test output in the terminal shows a **symptom** of the test failing, or more specifically, of an error causing an infinite loop, caused by the failure-inducing input (the test file with a link without parenthesis, or a false link). In this case, the symptom is a little less explicit, as it is **implying** an infinite loop exists from its inability to compile. The output does not show a stack trace either, but sometimes, as shown in the first example, **JUnit** can catch such an error and display it accordingly regardless.

There are many other methods of testing beyond unit testing, and there are definitely other methods than **JUnit**, and I encourage you to explore them. Keep in mind that there will be more software even within the same language!

Hopefully this blog helps you debug your programs in the future!
