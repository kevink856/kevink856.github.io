As mentioned in previous blogs, having the ability of programming on a remote server offers vast opportunity. Likewise, there is also vast opportunity to improve the process of programming remotely to make it more efficient and effective.

This tutorial will show some examples of improving the process of programming on a remote server as an introduction to simplifying some of the complicated and lengthy tasks involved with it.

## **Streamlining SSH**

Connecting to a remote system using `ssh` may get very tedious, even while utilizing SSH keys, as the command for logging in can be long depending on what **username** and **hostname** you use.

For example, for UCSD's "ieng6" machines, the **hostname** is `ieng6.ucsd.edu`, and the **username** follows the format `cs15lsp22zzz`. As such, the default way of connecting using `ssh` with this **hostname** and **username** would be to use the following command:

**`ssh cs15lsp22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

Of course, there is always the option of using the up-arrow key on the keyboard to bring up previously used commands, but on big projects, going back hundreds of commands to find this one may not be practical. Saving this command somewhere to memorize it is certainly not practical either.

The solution is to streamline SSH configuration. By editing the `config` file correlating with SSH, we can add a shortcut to connect to a specific system.

The directory of this file can be found here:

![Config Path](/images/blog_images/blog_03/path.png)
> Note: The absolute path is **C:/Users/\<user\>/.ssh/config** If `config` does not exist in this directory, you can simply create it manually

As is suggested in this image, `config` does not have a file extension (ie. there is no .cfg, .exe or any other suffix that follows). This means most OS, including Windows, will not have a default program to open or edit these files. One way of editing it is with a Source Code Editor like [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Notepad++</b></span>](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You can also simply open it with an IDE like [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Visual Studio Code</b></span>](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

In `config`, we can use the "Host" directive to create an alias that acts as a shortcut for an `ssh` command:

![Config File](/images/blog_images/blog_03/config.png)
> The alias following "Host" (In this case, `ieng6`) can be anything you want, but it will be the alias you call to connect to this system. 

With these lines, we can use this alias in executing a much shorter command that will also achieve connecting to the remote system:

**`ssh ieng6`**

Of course, if your alias following "Host" is not `ieng6`, the command will simply replace `ieng6` with whatever the alias is set to be.

Using the command may look something like this:

![SSH ieng6](/images/blog_images/blog_03/ssh_ieng6.png)

As shown in the image, we can fully connect to any system using only an alias (In this case, `ieng6`)! An alias can also be used in place of any argument of any command requiring the **hostname** and **username** of a remote connection. For example, when using `scp`, we can use `ieng6` in place of the long address of the destination:

![SSH and SCP](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scp_ieng6.png)
> Note that `:~/` must follow even an alias for this intended function of `scp`

Streamlining SSH connecting with an alias proves to make the process of working with a remote environment much more efficient and practical!

## **Remote GitHub Access**

When working from the terminal, being able to use `git` allows remote development especially powerful, as we don't even need any interfaces to push and pull on a repository! However, by default, commands like `push` cannot be used in the terminal, and thus in a remote environment without some extra steps.

To enable `git push` on the terminal (Specifically, from a remote system), it is necessary to create a new SSH key and link the remote system with a GitHub account with access to whatever repository is being worked on. This is because GitHub no longer supports using a username and password for `git push`, so a personal token like an SSH key is necessary.

The first step is to create a new SSH key pair on the remote system that we will use `git` from (This can also be done locally to enable these `git` command on the terminal):

**`ssh-keygen`**

Using the command will prompt a message like this:

![SSH Keygen](/images/blog_images/blog_03/sshkey.png)

To make it easy to locate the key we make and access it, a more intuitive name for the key can be specified instead of a randomly generated filename:

![SSH Keygen Path](/images/blog_images/blog_03/sshkeygenpath.png)
> Note: The path is absolute and the actual name of the file is where the key pair will be stored (id_rsa_github)

After using this command, the remote system will store a pair of **public** and **private** keys in /.ssh, or whatever path was specified in the command, with the name `id_rsa_github`. The **public** key will have the suffix / file extension `.pub`, while the **private** key will not have any suffix / file extension:

![.ssh Path](/images/blog_images/blog_03/sshpath.png)
> Note: The commands used show the file contents of ~/.ssh/, meaning with the previous commands, the key pair will be stored in .ssh/ in the home directory.

In order to now link this SSH key between the remote system and a GitHub account, the contents of the **public** key must be saved in the GitHub account settings.

For the **public** key, the contents can be printed and copied simply using the `cat` command, which will print the contents of the file in the terminal:

![SSH Key Printed](/images/blog_images/blog_03/sshkeyprint.png)
> Note: The `.pub` file is being printed, not the extensionless file. The actual contents of the **public** key are much longer than what is censored

This key can be copied and saved on the GitHub account here:

![SSH Key GitHub](/images/blog_images/blog_03/sshgithub.png)
> For a more detailed explanation on adding a new SSH key to a GitHub account, read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Multiple SSH keys can be used like shown, which serves the purpose of enabling git commands on multiple systems.

Now that the remote system's SSH key has been linked to this GitHub account, changes to any repository can be **committed** and **pushed** to the main branch with full permission. 

Here is an example of the process of using `git` commands to interact with a repository in the terminal, from cloning it to pushing finalize changes to the main branch:

![GitHub Clone Link](/images/blog_images/blog_03/githubclone.png)
> This particular **SSH** link must be used to clone a repository to a remote system in order to push changes

![Git Clone](/images/blog_images/blog_03/gitclone.png)

After cloning the repository, upon making a change (for example, adding a new file called exampleFile.txt), the change can be added to the **staging area** before being committed to the **main** branch, and finally, pushing it to the **origin**.

![Repo Create File](/images/blog_images/blog_03/gittouch.png)
> `exampleFile.txt` is the file to be added

![Git Add](/images/blog_images/blog_03/gitadd.png)
> Note: `git status` shows the staging area, or the files that have been added, but these files are what *will* be committed

![Git Commit](/images/blog_images/blog_03/gitcommit.png)
> Note: The option `-m` was added with the argument **"Testing GitHub Access"**, meaning the argument will be a summary message for the commit that appears in the commit history

Finally, these changes that have been added and committed to the main branch are pushed to the origin, updating the live version of the repository:

![Git Push](/images/blog_images/blog_03/gitpush.png)
> This new change can be seen on the live version of this public repository [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>here</b></span>](https://github.com/kevink856/markdown-parser/commit/5747b6aace069d5166eef0c34e8dc116b3a9c0f9).

Having the ability of using `git` to its full potential in the terminal allows remote development to contend with local development, being quicker and more effective in some areas. You will see your efficiency in working on GitHub projects be much better when utilizing both!

## **Improving SCP**

`scp` is a very powerful command, allowing two systems to remotely interact very efficiently. However, it can be frustratingly ineffective in transferring many files between two systems, especially when whole directories need to be transferred.

Thankfully, `scp` has an option called `-r`, which allows `scp` to work **recursively**. 

To use this option, the command should be in the following syntax:

**`scp -r <directory to copy> <destination directory>`**

For example, to copy the entire "markdown-parse" repository directory from the previous example to the remote system, the command would look like this:

![SCP Recursive](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scp_r.png)
> Note: The directory to copy is `.` in this example, which means current directory. The current directory can be seen before the command, which is markdown-parser

Upon copying this entire repository to the remote system, functionality can be tested by running tests that have already been implemented in the project. If the copying is successful, what works on the local system should equally work on the remote system it was copied to.

![SCP Tests](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scptest.png)

The actual commands for running these tests using **JUnit** are much longer than what is shown:

**`javac -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar MarkdownParseTest.java; java -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MarkdownParseTest`**

As shown in the image above, the tests all pass, indicating that the directory was copied correctly, and maintained its functionality.

Additionally, if such tests need to be executed for the directory within the location to where it is copied, it may be more practical to copy the directory, compile the tests, and run the tests all in one line. Accomplishing that with **JUnit** tests in the previous way can be done with the following command (assuming the current directory is the directory that will be copied):

**`scp -r . ieng6:markdown-parser; ssh ieng6 "javac -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar MarkdownParseTest.java; java -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MarkdownParseTest"`**
> Note: `scp` and `ssh` are separated with `;` to run in succession, while the commands to compile and run the tests are wrapped in `""`, as that is what allows those commands to execute automatically after logging into `ssh`. 

Running this command would look something like this:

![SCP SSH Tests 1](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scpsshtest_1.png)
![SCP SSH Tests 2](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scpsshtest_2.png)

There are many more ways to improve the process of remote development, such as using scripts and optimizing `config` further. Hopefully this tutorial has established the basics for you to efficiently program in a remote environment!
