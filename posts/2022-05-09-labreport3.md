# Blog #3 - Improving Remote Systems

> *Tutorial on using SSH remote systems more effectively by streamlining SSH configuration, setting up GitHub access, and on a remote system*

As mentioned in previous blogs, having the ability of programming on a remote server offers vast opportunity. Likewise, there is also vast opportunity to improve the process of programming remotely to make it more efficient and effective.

This tutorial will show some examples of improving the process of programming on a remote server as an introduction to simplifying some of the complicated and lengthy tasks involved with it.

## **Streamlining SSH**

Connecting to a remote system using `ssh` may get very tedious, even while utilizing SSH keys, as the command for logging in can be long depending on what **username** and **hostname** you use.

For example, for UCSD's "ieng6" machines, the **hostname** is `ieng6.ucsd.edu`, and the **username** follows the format `cs15lsp22zzz`. As such, the default way of connecting using `ssh` with this **hostname** and **username** would be to use the following command:

**`ssh cs15lsp22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`**

Of course, there is always the option of using the up-arrow key on the keyboard to bring up previously used commands, but on big projects, going back hundreds of commands to find this one may not be practical. Saving this command somewhere to memorize it is certainly not practical either.

The solution is to streamline SSH configuration. By editing the `config` file correlating with SSH, we can add a shortcut to connect to a specific system.

The directory of this file can be found here:

![Config Path](/images/blog_images/blog_03/path.png)
> Note: The absolute path is **C:/Users/\<user\>/.ssh/config** If `config` does not exist in this directory, you can simply create it manually

As is suggested in this image, `config` does not have a file extension (ie. there is no .cfg, .exe or any other suffix that follows). This means most OS, including Windows, will not have a default program to open or edit these files. One way of editing it is with a Source Code Editor like [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Notepad++</b></span>](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You can also simply open it with an IDE like [<span style="color:#367eba"><b>Visual Studio Code</b></span>](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

In `config`, we can use the "Host" directive to create an alias that acts as a shortcut for an `ssh` command:

![Config File](/images/blog_images/blog_03/config.png)
> The alias following "Host" (In this case, `ieng6`) can be anything you want, but it will be the alias you call to connect to this system. 

With these lines, we can use this alias in executing a much shorter command that will also achieve connecting to the remote system:

**`ssh ieng6`**

Of course, if your alias following "Host" is not `ieng6`, the command will simply replace `ieng6` with whatever the alias is set to be.

Using the command may look something like this:

![SSH ieng6](/images/blog_images/blog_03/ssh_ieng6.png)

As shown in the image, we can fully connect to any system using only an alias (In this case, `ieng6`)! An alias can also be used in place of any argument of any command requiring the **hostname** and **username** of a remote connection. For example, when using `scp`, we can use `ieng6` in place of the long address of the destination:

![SSH and SCP](/images/blog_images/blog_03/scp_ieng6.png)
> Note that `:~/` must follow even an alias for this intended function of `scp`

Streamlining SSH connecting with an alias proves to make the process of working with a remote environment much more efficient and practical!
